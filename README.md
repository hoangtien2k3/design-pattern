## Use Design Pattern because?
- ✅ Reusable code and easy to expand
- ✅ `Design pattern` helps increase code reuse, reduce complexity, and increase flexibility in software development.
- ✅ These are optimized solutions that we can use depending on the situation without thinking.
- ✅ At the same time increases the speed of development and testing for developers
- ✅ Of course the code will become easier to read and understand, along with being easier to maintain and upgrade in the future.
- ✅ Save time working with other developers' code.

## Classification of Design Patterns:
Design Patterns has 23 patterns defined inside and divided into 3 groups.
- `Creational Pattern`
- `Structural Pattern`
- `Behavioral Pattern`

### 1. Creational Patterns (Creational Group)
`Includes 5 models`: Provides a solution to create an object and hide the logic that creates it instead of creating it directly, giving the program more flexibility in which object it wants to create and in which situation.


### 2. Structural Patterns (Structural Group)
`Includes 7 models`: Helps us establish relationships between objects.


### 3. Behavioral Patterns (Group Interaction)
`Includes 11 models`: Provides solutions to perform the behavior of objects as well as between objects.
